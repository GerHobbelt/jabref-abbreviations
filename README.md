Jabref journal name abbreviations
=================================

Some journal require you to use the abbreviated names for journals. If you have
to change this manually, it's quite cumbersome to do. Luckyly there exist tools
to help. [Jabref](http://jabref.sourceforge.net) is open source bibliography
reference manager. It has an option to abbreviate journal names. However,
when it comes to Physics journals, the internal list is far from complete.

I have converted the list of abbreviations from [ISI](https://images.webofknowledge.com/WOK46/help/WOS/A_abrvjt.html) to a Jabref readable
format.
The file is in UTF-8 as some journal names have non-ascii characters.

Jabref journal name abbreviations
=================================

Some journal require you to use the abbreviated names for journals. If you have
to change this manually, it's quite cumbersome to do. Lucky there exist tools
to help. [Jabref](http://jabref.sourceforge.net) is open source bibliography
reference manager. It has an option to abbreviate journal names. However,
when it comes to Physics journals, the internal list is far from complete.

I have converted the list of abbreviations from [1] to a Jabref readable
format.
